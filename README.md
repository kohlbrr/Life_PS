# PS_life
PowerShell implementation of Conway's Game of Life
---
Since I was interested in Conway's Game of Life, I thought it would be a fun idea to create
an implementation that worked in PowerShell.

The functions inside of 'life.ps1' are enough to allow the game to be played. The other code
within is just a way to run the game from 0-100 generations within the console.
